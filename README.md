My task is to build a suites landing page that will look close to the orginal design. The purpose to test my understanding basic frontend coding skills using html and css. The design was made available via figma which provided the basic dimensions necessary for the design. The font family, size style and color were all included in the design system to make the navigation smooth.

All the required assets for this project are in the /assets folder. The assets provided supported  actual screen sizes with regards to desktop, tablet and mobile.

Initiated the project with VScode with a repository at github.com. The name of the repo Amalitech.project.

**<ins>Index.html</ins>**
index.html file includes a basic template with a link to the css/styles.css file. This basic ensures a communication between the html instuctions and css. The coding of the project began with the html file. This ensures the layout, demarcations paragraphs and sections. All my coding began with the html so i will lay the structure of the design.
